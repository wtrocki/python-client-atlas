# atlas.model.storage_engine.StorageEngine

Storage engine set for the specific index. This value can be set only at creation. This option uses the following format: `\"storageEngine\" : { \"<storage-engine-name>\" : \"<options>\" }` MongoDB validates storage engine configuration options when creating indexes. To support replica sets with members with different storage engines, MongoDB logs these options to the oplog during replication. This option applies to all index types.
